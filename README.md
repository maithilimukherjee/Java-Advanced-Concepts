# java advanced stuff 

just some dope java programs to flex those oop & collection skills.

## what’s in here 

1. **multilevel inheritance**  
   subclasses on subclasses vibes. see how inheritance chains across grandparent → parent → child.  

2. **multiple inheritance**  
   java doesn’t do it with classes, but interfaces got you covered. no drama, just clean code.  

3. **interfaces & multiple inheritance**  
   implement as many interfaces as you want. solves that classic diamond problem hassle-free.  

4. **base class reference**  
   reference a parent but call child methods. polymorphism doing its magic. ✨  

5. **inner class & nested class**  
   non-static vs static nested classes. peek into how they vibe with the outer class.  

6. **polymorphism**  
   override stuff, let java decide which method to call at runtime. dynamic AF.  

7. **iterator class**  
   walk through collections like a boss. includes a student list example.
